# Introduction

This section dives deep into the world of vulnerabilities and explores how they can be identified, understood, and mitigated through practical code examples.

Learning application security is a crucial skill and while there are many excellent resources available, one of the most effective ways to grasp security concepts is through coding scenarios. After all, application vulnerabilities exist because of coding implementations in the first place.

This guide focuses on a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and many more. Each vulnerability is explained in detail, accompanied by code examples that demonstrate how the vulnerability can be exploited and how it can be prevented.

The guide starts by presenting a vulnerable scenario, showcasing code that contains a security flaw. The vulnerability is then explained in detail, highlighting how an attacker could exploit it to compromise the application or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Next, each guide provides step-by-step instructions and secure coding practices that can be applied to fix the vulnerability.

A Semgrep rule is included for each vulnerability scenario. Semgrep is a static code analysis tool that helps identify potential security issues in codebases. The provided rules serve as a starting point for detecting and preventing vulnerabilities in your own projects. These rules can be integrated into development workflows to catch security flaws early in the SDLC.

It's important to note that while this guide focuses on learning through coding scenarios, it is not an exhaustive list of all application security vulnerabilities. There are many other excellent resources available that cover additional vulnerabilities, security best practices, and theoretical concepts.
